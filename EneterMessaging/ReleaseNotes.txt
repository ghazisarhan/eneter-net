Version 4.0

Release Date: 2012-03-03

Supported Platforms:

    Java 6 and Android 2.1 (or later)
    .Net 3.5, .Net 4.0, Silverlight 3, Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 7.1 and Mono 2.6.4

New Features:

    Cross-platform communication between .NET, Java and Android applications.
    Silverlight 5 and Windows Phone 7.1 supported
    Possibility to supply a custom encoder/formatter for the low-level communication between channels.

Changes in behavior:

    Formatting of messages was changed. Therefore, applications based on Eneter 4.0 cannot communicate with applications based on previous Eneter versions.
    The formatting was changed because the encoding information (i.e. Big or Little Endian, and UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be included in the message for the Cross-platform communication.
    However, the API is still the same. Therefore, to migrate to Eneter 4.0 just update references in your project and rebuild.

Cross-platform Notes:

    Binary serializer cannot be used for the communication between Java and .NET based applications.

Fixed Bugs:

    0000013 - EneterTrace causes a security exception in Silverlight.
